Bonus explanation
The look behind function highlights what comes after any period followed by a space. The \w+
is to tell it to highlight at least one word. The very first word in the text "Natural" is not
after a period and a space, which is why I put the second part next to the | symbol which
means "or". What comes after the | symbol is a ^ symbol, to signify "start with" and then \w+, to
signify at least one word.
Bonus: (?<=\. )\w+|^\w+
